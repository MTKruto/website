In server-sids projects running on Bun or Node.js, the `@mtkruto/node` package
can be used.

It supports both ECMAScript and CommonJS.

   following command.

```shell
deno add jsr:@mtkruto/mtkruto
```

2. If your project is developed using Node.js with a framework like (Next.js,
   SvelteKit, etc.) or a bundler (Parcel, Vite, etc.), install MTKruto using one
